# k-Nearest Neighbours Movie Recommender System
This [script](https://github.com/srotberg/movie_k_nearest_neighbours_recommender_system/blob/master/k-nearest_neighbours_recommender_system_example.py) recommends movies that user_id has not yet seen. The code is based 
on the how similar user_id is in taste other users. The system generates a list of the k-most similar users based on a distance function that takes into account the difference in adjusted ratings of each user relative to the adjusted ratings by user_id and the number of movies both of user_id and each other user saw. Then, the system takes all the movies user_id has not seen and weighs them by their average rating and by the number of k most similar other users who saw them. It lists the movies from top to bottom ratings.

You will need to use these packages:
