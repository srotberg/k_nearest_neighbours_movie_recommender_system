"""
k-nearest neighbours recommender system
The system recommends movies that a user_id has not yet seen
based on the how similar they are in taste other users. 
The system generates a list of k most similar users based on 
a distance function that takes into account the difference
in adjusted ratings of each user from user_id and the number
of movies both of them saw. Then, the system takes all the movies 
user_id has not seen and weighs them their average rating and 
by the number of k most similar other users who saw them
